# join-two-numbers-txt
Join numbers with a hyphen when they appear in the same row- 100 1 becomes 100-1.

Useful for pulling bulk map and lot data from GIS or other programs, copying from a spreadsheet and then being able to merge columns.
Often, this data is separated into two columns but needs to be joined to conduct a search.
